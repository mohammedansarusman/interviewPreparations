The main difference between a library and a framework lies in control flowâ€”who is in charge, you or the code you're using. Here's a breakdown:

ðŸ”¹ Library
You call the library.
Itâ€™s a collection of functions/methods you can use in your own code.
Youâ€™re in control of the flow of the program.
Think of it like: "I use the library when I want, how I want."

Example:
Using Math.sqrt() in JavaScript or NumPy in Pythonâ€”you decide when and how to use the functions.

ðŸ”¹ Framework
The framework calls you.
It provides a structure and you plug your code into it.
The framework controls the flowâ€”you follow its rules.
Think of it like: "I write some code, but the framework is the boss."

Example:
With web frameworks like Django or React, you follow the framework's structure and it calls your code at the appropriate time (e.g., routing, rendering).

ðŸ§  Easy Analogy:
Library: You're the chef; you pick and use tools from the kitchen.

Framework: You're on a cooking show; the show gives you the format and tells you what to do when.

âœ… Officially, React is a library, not a framework.
Why?
React focuses only on the UI layer (building components and rendering views).

Youâ€™re still in control of things like routing, data fetching, and state management (unless you add other tools).

So, React gives you the tools, but you decide how to structure the app.

ðŸ¤” But... it feels like a framework sometimes?
Yes, because:

Itâ€™s often used with extras like React Router, Redux, or Next.js.

Combined, these tools start acting like a full framework.

For example, Next.js is actually considered a framework built on top of React.
