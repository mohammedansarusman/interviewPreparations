React JS is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook, used to build fast and interactive user interfaces, especially for web apps.

It uses a component-based architecture, which means the UI is split into reusable pieces.

React uses a virtual DOM to optimize updates, making it very fast. JSX (JavaScript XML) is used to write components in a way that looks like HTML but works like JavaScript.

State - to store a value ( string, number, array, object ... )

class based componenets - code readabilty is not good, using lot of this command can cause lot of memory leaks.

Node Modules:-
In dependencies you can see react, react dom and other packages. these packages using other packages are saved in node modules.
node modules will not push in git or production due to high memory space consumption.

Nested objects one example
const company = {
  userName: {
    employeeName: "Web Developer"
  }
}

const { userName: {employeeName} } = company;

console.log("emp:",employeeName)
