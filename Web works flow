🌐 How the Web Works — A Simple Breakdown

When a user enters a URL (like www.example.com) in the browser, here's what happens behind the scenes:

DNS Lookup: The browser checks with the DNS (Domain Name System) to find the IP address associated with that domain name.

Connecting to the Server: Once the IP address is found, the browser sends a request to the server at that address.

Server Response: The server processes the request and sends back the website’s files — typically HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Rendering the Page: The browser then uses these files to display the website on the user's screen.

This process happens in just milliseconds!

Understanding this flow is key to diving deeper into web development and networking. 💡
